  <p>Thanks for visiting the site! I solve a wide range of data puzzles as a consultant at <a href="http://team3si.com/">Third Sector Intelligence (3SI)</a> in Seattle.</p>

  <p>I use whatever tools are best suited to the analysis and data management work. Typically, I seek solutions in R, Python, and SQL, but develop products in whatever software and code is necessary to get the job done well. Clients tend to like <a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a> these days, so I use it too.</p>

  <p>Before joining 3SI, I completed an MPA at the <a href="https://evans.uw.edu/">University of Washington Evans School of Governance and Public Policy</a> and an MA at the <a href="https://www.upeace.org/">United Nations University for Peace</a>. I also lived in Latin America for many years, where I taught in the IB Diploma program at <a href="http://www.uwccostarica.org/">United World College</a>, edited a <a href="http://www.monitor.upeace.org/">peace and conflict journal</a>, and developed strategy for implementing governance and social mobility projects.</p>

  <p>You can find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/grahambearden/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gbearden">GitHub</a>, and on the <a href="http://team3si.com/teammembers/graham-bearden-consultant/">3SI staff site</a>.</p>
  
  <p>If we meet, ask me about: the best podcast episode ever, stingless bees, plantintas, light roast coffees (because they're better), and where to eat in Seattle.</p>
