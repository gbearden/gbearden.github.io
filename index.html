  <p>Hi. I'm Graham. Thanks for visiting the site! I solve a wide-range of data puzzle as a consultant at <a href="http://team3si.com/">Third Sector Intelligence (3SI)</a> in Seattle.</p>

  <p>When working on an analysis project, I use whatever tools are best suited to the work. [...]</p>

  <p>Before joining 3SI, I completed an MPA at the <a href="https://evans.uw.edu/">University of Washington Evans School of Governance and Public Policy</a> and an MA at the <a href="https://www.upeace.org/">United Nations University for Peace</a>.</p>

  <p>Prior to moving to Seattle, I lived in the Costa Rica and Bolivia, where I taught in the IB Diploma program at <a href="http://www.uwccostarica.org/">United World College</a> and consulted on governance and social mobility projects.</p>

  <p>You can find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/grahambearden/">LinkedIn</a>, GitHub, and  <a href="http://team3si.com/teammembers/graham-bearden-consultant/">here</a> on the 3SI site.</p>
